# Ownable Smart Contract

This is a simple Solidity smart contract called `Ownable`. It allows for ownership management, where only the owner of the contract can execute certain functions.

## Overview

The `Ownable` smart contract provides the following functionalities:

- It stores the address of the owner when the contract is deployed.
- It includes a `onlyowner` modifier to restrict access to specific functions to only the owner.
- It provides a `setNewOwner` function that allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address.

## Prerequisites

Before using this smart contract, you should have the following:

- A development environment set up for Ethereum smart contract development (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).
- Basic knowledge of Ethereum and Solidity programming.

## Usage

1. **Deployment:**

   - Deploy this smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain. Ensure you specify the owner when deploying.

2. **Ownership Transfer:**

   - Once deployed, the owner can transfer ownership to another address using the `setNewOwner` function. Provide the address of the new owner as an argument.

3. **Modifier `onlyOwner`:**

   - Use the `onlyOwner` modifier in your functions to restrict access to the owner only. For example:

   ```solidity
   function someFunction() public onlyOwner {
       // Only the owner can execute this function
       // Add your logic here
   }
   ```

4. **Additional Information:**

   - Ensure that you provide a valid Ethereum address when transferring ownership using the `setNewOwner` function.
   - Remember that the owner can change ownership to any valid address, so exercise caution.
